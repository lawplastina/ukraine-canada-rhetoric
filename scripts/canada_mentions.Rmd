### Notes

* These are all the documents where Canada is mentioned by anybody, not simply all the documents where Trump mentions Canada - so there are 161 documents instead of 127. 

* Any document that doesn't clearly denote speakers is one of Donald Trump's Truth Social posts. 

* Many of the Truth Social posts are very short, since he frequently reposts other accounts or posts images/videos without much text attached.

* All the documents are in date order (oldest to newest) and the dates are listed before each document.
